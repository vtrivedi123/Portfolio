My Github account is used to showcase personal projects that I have and will make in the future, while this repository is for my portfolio website which I made using HTML and CSS.<br>
</br>
Using GitHub desktop, I cloned my repository by going to `file >> clone repository` in the application and choosing a folder where it can be accessed. This allowed me to transfer all the required website files with ease. After that, I committed the changes and pushed it to the GitHub server remotely by clicking push at the top.
