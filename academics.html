			I created this 3D model in my Engineering Graphics class at <a href="https://waketech.edu">Wake Tech</a> by using a measuring tool to get the exact dimensions and putting together the model using the assembly feature in <a href="https://www.solidworks.com">Solidworks</a> after modeling everything.

		<p>In continuation, during my time In high school, I made a presentation about a mobile application that uses a GPS to track whether or not someone has been outside for a day or longer. If they have not gone outside, it would sound an alarm notifying them to leave their house. My pitch to real investers was that it would be beneficial for an application like that to be created because during the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">COVID-19 </a>pandemic, people didn't want to leave their homes much, so that would annoy them into going outside for some fresh air if nothing else. I ended up getting mainly good remarks from them. The only thing they said was for me to speak clearly. I took that into consideration when I signed up for the public speaking class at Wake Tech.</p>
